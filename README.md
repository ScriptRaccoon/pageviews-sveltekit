# Page Visits for SvelteKit apps

This repository demonstrates how to track and visualize page visits in a SvelteKit application. The approach is explained in the blog post [**How to track page visits in SvelteKit**](https://scriptraccoon.dev/blog/track-page-visits-sveltekit). In short, when a page loads, a request is sent to `/api/track` where the page view is stored in the database. A password-protected dashboard at `/page-visits` displays page visits over time.
